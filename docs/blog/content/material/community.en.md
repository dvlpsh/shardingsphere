As an honored speaker, Liang Zhang, the PPMC, gave a talk named exploring and expanding the Apache ShardingSphere community. The main points of this topic are as follows.

### 01 Why open source?

For individuals, you can gain a better career and find enjoyment.

#### A better career

1. More career opportunities. Industries can establish the cloud platform and provide business services through open-source projects. Besides, by contributing to the open-source community, industries can enhance their technical influence. Since industries can benefit from open source, many of them are hungry for open-source talents. The open-source job is always technique-related and community-based, which relatively makes your schedule listen to yourself.

2. Better capability. By contributing to the open-source community, you can improve not only technical skills but also soft skills like Language skills, social skills, and marketing skills. In addition, you will achieve innovation ability as well,  if you have a chance to create a brand new open-source project.

3. Great personal relationship. You will not only focus on your job, salary, KPI, e.t. Those industry-related activities, such as attending a seminar,  tech sharing, writing blogs, even tech investing, will attract your attention. Besides, you can also communicate and make friends with foreign people worldwide in the international open-source community. As this phrase said, engage your body familiar with job skills; engage your mind closed to the world. The open-source experience will bring you more potential opportunities.

4. Earned public recognition. The effort of open-source work you did is totally open to anyone at any time, which means you can gradually receive public recognition. In contrast, the effort of in-company work is supposed to be judged by your leaders themselves, not the public, which means an inadequate evaluation is likely to give.

#### An enjoyable career

1. Self-growth. If you enjoy doing one work, you will grow up with pleasure. As a software engineer, you should learn to enjoy your work and be a self-driven person, which is the real shortcut to success.

2. Accomplishment sense. When your work is recognized by others, when your work made the project better and better, when you got new skills, you will strongly feel the sense of accomplishment and the pleasure of your career.
