## Background

Though ShardingSphere intends to be compatible with all the SQLs and stand-alone databases, distributed style has brought more complex situations to the database. 
ShardingSphere wants to solve massive data OLTP problem first, and complete relevant OLAP support problem little by little.

Please further read the [SQL type that is available and unavailable for ShardingSphere](/en/features/sharding/use-norms/sql) as well as problems aiming at [pagination](/en/features/sharding/use-norms/pagination), the kind of problem that is highly related to the performance.
