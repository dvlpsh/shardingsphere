Since the syntax of SQL is flexible and complex and query situations of distributed databases and stand-alone databases are not identical with each other, SQLs incompatible with stand-alone databases are hard to avoid.

To try to avoid traps for users, this document has listed identified available SQL types and unavailable SQL types.

It is inevitably to have some SQLs that have not been listed yet, welcome to supplement for that. 
We will also try to support those unavailable SQLs in future versions.

## Available SQL

### Route to single data node

- 100% compatible（MySQL only, other database dialect is doing).

### Route to multiple data nodes or database beside MySQL

Fully available for DQL, DML, DDL, DCL, TCL and some DAL for MySQL. 
Available for pagination, DISTINCT, ORDER BY, GROUP BY, aggregation and JOIN(cannot support cross database). 
Here is an example of a most complex kind of DQL:

- Main SELECT

```sql
SELECT select_expr [, select_expr ...] FROM table_reference [, table_reference ...]
[WHERE where_condition] 
[GROUP BY {col_name | position} [ASC | DESC]] 
[ORDER BY {col_name | position} [ASC | DESC], ...] 
[LIMIT {[offset,] row_count | row_count OFFSET offset}]
```

- select_expr

```sql
* | 
[DISTINCT] COLUMN_NAME [AS] [alias] | 
(MAX | MIN | SUM | AVG)(COLUMN_NAME | alias) [AS] [alias] | 
COUNT(* | COLUMN_NAME | alias) [AS] [alias]
```

- table_reference

```sql
tbl_name [AS] alias] [index_hint_list] | 
table_reference ([INNER] | {LEFT|RIGHT} [OUTER]) JOIN table_factor [JOIN ON conditional_expr | USING (column_list)] | 
```

## Unavailable SQL

### Route to multiple data nodes or database beside MySQL

Unavailable for redundant parentheses, CASE WHEN, HAVING and UNION (ALL) and partly available for sub-query.

Available for not only sub-query of pagination (see [pagination](https://shardingsphere.apache.org/document/current/cn/features/sharding/usage-standard/pagination) for detail), but also sub-query with equivalent pattern. 
No matter how many layers are nested, ShardingSphere can parse to the first sub-query that contains data table. 
Once it finds another sub-query of this kind in the sub-level nested, it will directly throw a parsing exception.

For example, the following sub-query is available for ShardingSphere:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM (SELECT * FROM t_order o)
```
 
The following sub-query is unavailable:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM (SELECT * FROM t_order o WHERE o.id IN (SELECT id FROM t_order WHERE status = ?))
```

To be simple, through sub-query, non-functional requirements are available in most cases, such as pagination, sum count and so on; but functional requirements are unavailable for now.

Due to the restriction of merger, sub-query that contains aggregate function is unavailable for now.

SQL that contains schema is unavailable, for the concept of ShardingSphere is to use multiple data source as one data source, so all the SQL visits are based on one logic schema.
