## Background

`APM` is the abbreviation of Application Performance Monitoring. Currently its core function is the performance diagnosis of distributed system, including call chain demonstration, application topology analysis, etc.

[Sharding-Sphere](http://shardingsphere.io) Team work with [SkyWalking](http://skywalking.io) Team to introduce an automatic monitor agent of `Sharding-Sphere` to send tracing data of `Sharding-Sphere` to `SkyWalking`.

## Usage

### Using SkyWalking

Please refer to [SkyWalking Manual](https://github.com/OpenSkywalking/skywalking/wiki/Quick-start-chn)。

### Using OpenTracing

If user want to use other APM systems which support [OpenTracing] (http://opentracing.io), just use sharding-sphere API to work with those APM systems.

* Inject the Tracer implementation class through System.properties
```
    System.Properties：-Dshardingsphere.opentracing.tracer.class=org.apache.skywalking.apm.toolkit.opentracing.SkywalkingTracer
    mehtod：ShardingTracer.init()                          
```

* Inject the Tracer implementation class through method parameter
```
    shardingTracer.init(new SkywalkingTracer())   
```

*Notices: When using SkyWalking's OpenTracing monitor agent, disabling the original Sharding-Sphere monitor agent plugin is necessary to avoid conflicting with each other.*

## UI

### Application schema

The application is a ` SpringBoot ` application, using ` Sharding-Sphere ` to access two databases of `ds0` and `ds1`, each owns two tables in database.

### Topology diagram

Although the user accesses the application once, each database is accessed twice. This is because this visit involves two splitting tables in each database, four tables in total.

You can see SQL routing, execution and final result set merge in this figure.

`/SHARDING-SPHERE/ROUTING/`: Represents the parsing and routing performance of this SQL.

`/SHARDING-SPHERE/EXECUTE/{SQLType}`: Represents the overall execution performance of this SQL.
