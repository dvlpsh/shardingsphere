## The global supported items

### DQL

#### Basic SELECT

```sql
SELECT select_expr [, select_expr ...] FROM table_reference [, table_reference ...]
[WHERE where_condition] 
[GROUP BY {col_name | position} [ASC | DESC]] 
[ORDER BY {col_name | position} [ASC | DESC], ...] 
[LIMIT {[offset,] row_count | row_count OFFSET offset}]
```

#### select_expr

```sql
* | 
COLUMN_NAME [AS] [alias] | 
(MAX | MIN | SUM | AVG)(COLUMN_NAME | alias) [AS] [alias] | 
COUNT(* | COLUMN_NAME | alias) [AS] [alias]
```

#### table_reference

```sql
tbl_name [AS] alias] [index_hint_list] | 
table_reference ([INNER] | {LEFT|RIGHT} [OUTER]) JOIN table_factor [JOIN ON conditional_expr | USING (column_list)] | 
```

## The global unsupported items

### Support some kinds of subqueries
Sharding-JDBC also supports other subqueries similar with paging subquery( [The Pagination](/02-guide/subquery/)). No matter how many layers in a subquery, Sharding-JDBC can always find the first subquery that contains the table data, once the sub-subquery containing table data is found in the lower nest, Sharding-JDBC will throw an exception.

For example, the following subquery is ok:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM (SELECT * FROM t_order o)
```

But this subquery will cause exceptionsï¼š

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM (SELECT * FROM t_order o WHERE o.id IN (SELECT id FROM t_order WHERE status = ?))
```

Simply speaking, none-functional subqueries can be supported in most cases, such as pagination or statistics, etc, but subqueries for business is not supported currently.

In addition, subqueries containing aggregate functions are not supported currently due to merge constraints.

### Does not support SQL that contains redundant parentheses

### Does not support OR

### Does not support CASE WHEN
