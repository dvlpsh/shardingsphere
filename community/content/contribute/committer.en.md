## Maintainersâ€™ Responsibilities

Maintainers are committers who spent a significant amount of time and energy to maintain the project components, which means a maintainer should:
 
 - Review PRs reliably and in time
 - Whittle down the Pull Request backlog actively
 - Answer problems
 - Receive core changes, bugs and feature requests
 - Make sure an important change is finished
 - Improve processes and tools
 - Refactor
